2014-12-18 (1.7.4)

- Adding uptime, cpu & memory usage to the ```check_nodes``` task

  #### Example

  ```rake check_nodes servers=1```

  Which outputs the following for each server:

  ```
  ================================================================================
  Node[1]: 111.11.11.111 (4956977736153893179C)
  ================================================================================
  Usage:             CPU: 27.1% | Memory: 61.7%
  Uptime:            0:1:32:35.744
  ```

- Adding ```download_logs``` task

  #### Example

  ```rake download_logs servers=1```

  Downloads the current forever and crypti log from each server to the local machine.
  Log files are saved into the relative ```logs/``` directory for further analysis, like so:

  ```
  1.forever.log
  1.crypti.log
  ```

  > NOTE: Previous downloads are deleted before each subsequent download.

- Adding ```clean_logs``` task

  #### Example

  ```rake clean_logs servers=1```

  Which does the following on each server:

  - Existing crypti log file is truncated to zero
  - Old crypti log file(s) are removed
  - Old forever log file(s) are removed

2014-12-15 (1.7.3)

This update coincides with the release of Crypti 0.1.8. The latest version of Crypti adds some welcome stability, quicker load times and more responsive node queries; which all contribute to making node deployment using CryptiKit a more pleasant experience.

#### Updates

- Updated crypti node to latest version: 0.1.8
- Adding environment option to config.yml
  - 'live' will deploy nodes onto the live blockchain using port 6040
  - 'test' will deploy nodes onto the test blockchain using port 7040

#### Bug Fixes

- Improved error handling when adding public ssh key to servers
  - Gracefully handling host key verification failures
  - Gracefully handling authentication failures
- Escaping all known reserved characters when saving passphrase to config
- Ensuring json responses are successful rather than merely populated
- Translating nil values encountered when node has just been started

2014-12-02 (1.7.2)

- Improved remove_servers command syntax

  #### Example

  You can now use the same targeting syntax as all other tasks.

  - Selection of servers: ```rake remove_servers servers=1,2,3```
  - Range of servers: ```rake remove_servers servers=1..3```
  - All servers: ```rake remove_servers servers=all```

- Highlighting balance changes between the last time the check_nodes task was run

  #### Example

  Applies to all balances generated by the check_nodes task: Account and Forged balances. Making it much easier to visually track when one of your nodes has forged some coins or their balances have changed in some other way.

  Upon first invocation you will see the following highlighted in blue, which indicates this is the first time you are running the report hence there are no changes:

  ```
  Balance:           1344.4791879 0.0 (*)
  ```

  When a balance has not changed you will see the following highlighted in yellow:

  ```
  Balance:           1344.4791879 0.0 (=)
  ```

  When a balance has increased by 100 you will see the following output highlighted in green:

  ```
  Balance:           1444.4791879 100.0 (+)
  ```

  When a balance has decreased by 100 you will see the following output highlighted in red:

  ```
  Balance:           1244.4791879 100.0 (-)
  ```

- Adding Generated and Last Generated timestamps to the check_nodes report summary

  #### Example

  At the bottom of each report summary there are now two timestamps representing the current and previous date & time the check_nodes task was run at.

  ```
  Generated:         2014-12-02 22:28:33 +0000
  Last Generated:    2014-12-02 21:24:03 +0000
  ```

2014-11-30 (1.7.1)

- Adding automatic detection of remote server architecture and operating system to the ```install_deps``` task

Instead of specifying your target operating system globally like so:  ```rake install_deps os=ubuntu```. You can now simply execute: ```rake install_deps```. After automatically detecting whether a server has a supported architecture and operating system, CryptiKit will then proceed to install the relevant dependencies for the given operating system.

> NOTE: The above changes also apply to the ```rake install_all``` command, which merely executes the ```install_deps``` and ```install_nodes``` commands sequentially using one convenient command.

Unsupported architectures and operating systems will raise an error. For a list of supported hosts and operating systems please see:

https://github.com/karmacoma/cryptikit/blob/v1.7.1/README.md#supported-hosts

- Adding automatic removal of ssh fingerprints from the ~/.ssh/known_hosts file after deleting a server using the ```remove_servers``` task

2014-11-27 (1.7.0)

- Adding support for deployment to CentOS and Fedora operating systems

For usage instructions please see:
https://github.com/karmacoma/cryptikit/blob/v1.7.0/README.md#typical-usage

For available operating systems for each supported host please see:
https://github.com/karmacoma/cryptikit/blob/v1.7.0/README.md#supported-hosts

- Implementing workaround for slow check_nodes task

Forging status is now checked separately from mining info; Allowing slow /api/getMiningInfo requests to be optionally avoided. Mining info can therefore be disabled permanently through config.yml or optionally at runtime from the command line.

For more information please see:
https://github.com/karmacoma/cryptikit/blob/v1.7.0/README.md#mining-info

- Downloading zip files to static file names; Allowing app and blockchain urls to be more easily customised without breaking CryptiKit

Example config.yml with customised URLs hosted on Dropbox:

```
app_url: https://www.dropbox.com/s/ygjs6wwukj3h3ho/crypti-linux-0.1.7.zip?dl=0
blockchain_url: https://www.dropbox.com/s/rbkx0rtvhp4xxbe/blockchain.db.zip?dl=0
```

2014-11-26 (1.6.5)

- Officially supporting additional hosts: Vultr and Wable
  - Tested on: Debian 7.0 x64 and Ubuntu 14.04 x64 operating systems
- Downloading GPG public key before installing or updating rvm

For more information regarding supported hosts see:
https://github.com/karmacoma/cryptikit/blob/v1.6.5/README.md#supported-hosts

2014-11-25 (1.6.4)

- Copying rather than moving config.yml when updating CryptiKit
- Escaping forward slash character when saving passphrase to config.json
- Adding connection and operation timeouts to curl requests
  - 30 seconds until connection to crypti node times out
  - 60 seconds until crypti API query times out
- Gracefully handling (CTRL+C) user interrupts

2014-10-24 (1.6.3)

- Reporting when nodes are being synchronised
- Optionally adding passphrase to remote server when starting to forge
- Stating more clearly when forging has been successfully enabled or disabled

For more information see:
https://github.com/karmacoma/cryptikit/blob/v1.6.3/README.md#typical-usage

2014-10-21 (1.6.2)

Fixed some issues I encountered when running the check_nodes task.

- Node's sync status is now checked before querying mining info or account balances
- Added warning message when a node's blockchain is still being loaded

2014-10-20 (1.6.1)

- Fixed network fee calculation:  
  Surplus withdrawals should now consistently leave a minimum of 1000 XCR plus some dust
- Allowing withdrawal / deposit address to be specified from the command line  
  For example:
  ```
  rake withdraw_surplus address=4956977736153893179C
  ```
- Re-factored number handling for better accuracy

2014-10-18 (1.6.0)

- Added withdraw_surplus task

The ```withdraw_surplus``` task withdraws any surplus balance above the minimum 1000 XCR required to start forging, to a designated crypti account.

Instructions for this new task are available here:
- https://github.com/karmacoma/cryptikit/blob/v1.6.0/README.md#surplus-withdrawals

2014-10-12 (1.5.1)
